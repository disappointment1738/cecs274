    "## INTERFACES\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (1 pt) Explain the difference between a data structure’s interface and its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The difference between an interface and its implementation is that the interface describes what the data structure does compared to the implementation, which describes how the data structures does it. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. (1 pt) True or False: An interface is also referred to as an abstract data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: True.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (1 pt) True or False: If two or more data structures implement a same interface, then they\n",
    "will have the same functionalities and same run-time efficiencies.\n",

    "Answer: False.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (a) (2 pts) Complete the sample project and submit it to the appropriate CodePost folder.\n",

    "5. (1 pt) A UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram depicts the relationships between two\n",

    "like the following:\n",
    "    ***See sheet in BB***\n",
    "This diagram says that the `Ant` and `Spider` classes implement the methods of the MobileCritter\n",
    "interface. Hence, if we instantiate an `Ant` or `Spider` object, we are expecting to be able to\n",
    "call any of the methods listed in the `MobileCritter` interface on the object. Moreover, `Ant`\n",
    "and `Spider` override the `__str__` method, i.e., they define the string that should be returned\n",
    "when the function `str()` is called on an object of the class.\n",
